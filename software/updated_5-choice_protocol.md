##### Updated 5-Choice Training Program

## New nosepoke light to trigger trial start at the back panel in the middle
## Magazine will be moved to right hand side

* TSL = Trial Start Light
* TSS = Trial Start Sensor
* MS = Magazine Sensor
* FD = food delivery

## Magazine Training:

* TSL turns on + food is delivered
* mouse nosepokes into the magazine to get the food
* this triggers TSL to turn off + variable ITI begins (4,8,16,or 32 sec)
* next trial begins
* This phase is 50 trials.

## Training 1 (Phase 1):

* TSL turns on 
* mouse nosepokes into Trial Start Hole + TSS detects it
* TSL turns off + food is delivered
* mouse nosepokes into the magazine to get the food
* next trial begins
* This phase is 50 trials.

## Training 2 (Phase 2):

* TSL turns on 
* mouse nosepokes into Trial Start Hole + TSS detects it
* TSL turns off
* 5 stimulus lights on the opposite wall turns on
* mouse nosepokes into one of them (sensor detects it)
* 5 stimulus lights turn off
* food is delivered
* next trial begins
* This phase is 50 trials.

## Training 3 (Phase 3):

* TSL turns on 
* mouse nosepokes into Trial Start Hole + TSS detects it
* TSL turns off
* 5 sec ITI
* Randomly chosen 1 stimulus light on the opposite wall turns on
* mouse nosepokes into one of them (sensor detects it)
* If nosepoked into a non-illumniated hole, there is no consequence, the trial begins again.
  * all lights off, no time out, start at the beg. again.
* If mouse nosepokes into the illuminated light, stimulus light turns off.
* food is delivered
* once mouse collects the food, there is 20 sec consumption interval (no light is on)
* next trial begins
* This phase is 100 trials.

## 5-Choice Training (Phase 4-8):

* TSL turns on 
* mouse nosepokes into Trial Start Hole + TSS detects it
* TSL turns off
* 5 sec ITI
* one Nosepoke turns on for SD time and turns off after that duration.
* If nosepoke into stimulus lights during ITI, record it as premature and Time-Out for 5 sec (no lights).
* Randomly chosen 1 stimulus light on the opposite wall turns on
* mouse nosepokes into one of them (sensor detects it)
* If nosepoked into a non-illumniated hole, record it as incorrect and Time-Out for 5 sec (no lights).
* If mouse nosepokes into the illuminated light, stimulus light turns off.
* food is delivered
* once mouse collects the food from magazine, there is 20 sec consumption interval (no light is on)
* If no nosepokes (SD+4sec), record it as an omission and Time-Out for 5 sec (no lights).
* next trial begins
* This phase is 100 trials.
