# Food dispenser

An automated feeding and storage tank for small animals during lab test. In this project its being used to reward the animal under test. After testing is done the feeding tank should be filled and programed to auto feed mode to ensure the animal is feed as per the diatery requirements.

> You can skip step 1 and 2, if you have purchased the parts.

## Step 1: Printing parts {:id="printing-parts" class="page-step"}

> Please follow the information on your slicing software and remember to add a brim where necessary. 

*  To accomplish this section you will need a [3d printer] and [PLA filament] to print the following parts:

## Step 2: Laser cut parts {:id="laser-cut-parts" class="page-step"}

* To accomplish this section you will need a [Laser cutter] and [clear plastic sheet] to cut the following:
    + [Outer cover](models/Outer_cover.svg "")
    + [Inner cover](models/Inner_cover.svg "")


## Step 3: Assemble the parts {:id="assemble-the-parts" class="page-step"}
1. Push the [Servo motor] on the 3d printed motor holder.
